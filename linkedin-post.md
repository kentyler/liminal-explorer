# LinkedIn Post Draft

I just open-sourced a tool that helps Claude explore the "liminal space" of conversations - those unspoken observations and adjacent possibilities that float just beyond what we explicitly discuss.

The idea came from a simple observation: the most interesting insights often emerge in the spaces between direct questions and answers. So I built an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets Claude:

üîç Respond to a period (.) with deeper exploration
ü§ñ Self-trigger when conversation patterns suggest hidden insights
üìä Monitor for concept density and unexplored connections

Example: After implementing a feature, type "." and Claude might surface architectural implications, systemic patterns, or alternative approaches you hadn't considered.

It's fascinating how building tools for better AI collaboration becomes an exercise in understanding our own thought patterns. The tool itself demonstrates liminal thinking - it exists between tool and thought partner, between explicit commands and implicit understanding.

For the technically curious: it's a Node.js MCP server that integrates with Claude Code (and any MCP-compatible Claude interface). No API keys or costs - it runs entirely locally.

What patterns do you notice in your AI collaborations that could benefit from deeper exploration?
